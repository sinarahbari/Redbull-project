            <h2>The back story of Red Bull's 1st motorsports athlete, F1's Gerhard Berger</h2>
            <p>Today,becoming a Red Bull-sponsored athlete can be a career-changing moment for motorsports athletes, and
                it all started with Austrian F1 legend Gerhard Berger in 1989.It wasn't just the considerable natural
                ability behind the wheel of a Formula One car (which earned him 10 Grand Prix wins with three different
                teams) that endeared Gerhard Berger to fans, rival drivers, and the sport's officials alike. In F1's
                ultra-competitive world he also possessed an easy charm, charisma, and fun-loving nature that made him
                seem a bit of a delightful throwback, too.
                So, it seemed a natural fit in 1989 when Red Bull decided that the Austrian driver should be taken on as
                their first sponsored athlete in a landmark deal.
                As Red Bull's figurehead driver, Berger's winning personality made him an instant success, but that
                easy-going nature and reputation as one of F1's great pranksters concealed just what a steely and
                courageous competitor he was something that was graphically illustrated in that very year. </p>

            <h2>Rally Estonia</h2>
            <p>One of the WRCs youngest encounters, this is only the championships fourth visit to southern Estonia. The
                pace is relentless as gravel roads featuring plenty of crests and jumps are paired with more technical
                sections on wide and narrow forest roads. Theyre billiard-table smooth too. Its the biggest motorsport
                event in the Baltic countries.The world of rally driving is unique and may be hard to understand. We
                want to make sure you're in the know, so we've got the answers to your most pressing questions.</p>
            <p>The big round of the FIA World Rally Championship Rally Estonia, the largest and most
                prestigious rallying event in the Baltic region, has announced an exciting cooperation with KWOTA, a
                leading SaaS platform for carbon emissions savings verification, and trading. The partnership aims to
                compensate Rally Estonia's carbon footprint of 600 tonnes through increased circularity and material
                reuse in material production, showcasing the event's commitment to sustainability and environmental
                responsibility. KWOTA enables businesses to actively reduce their carbon footprint in the present while
                they make the transition to long term sustainable practices. </p>
            <p>Hyundai, who took a double victory in Sardinia, were not in the same swing in Kenya and
                their cars were chased by various technical problems on the roads of Safari. Thierry Neuville/Martijn
                Wydaeghe's car, who fought for third place on Friday, had a shock absorber break on the sixth staget,
                and Esapekka Lappi/Janne Fermi, who held third place on Saturday, ended their hopes of a fourth
                consecutive podium place with a broken drive shaft. Dani Sordo/Candido Carrera, whose Hyundai i20 N
                Rally1 car had a steering problem on Sunday, took care of the best Hyundai team result, but nevertheless
                took fifth place behind the Toyotas. Neuville/Wydaeghe initially won the rally-ending PowerStage and
                finished eighth in the overall standings, but because they used outside assistance in two stages, their
                result was disqualified.</p>

            <h2>2022 F1 Esports - Race Eleven</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>A rainy day at Interlagos sees Frede bag another podium</h4>

            <p>As rain descended on Interlagos, The Bulls lined up on the grid ready to take on the penultimate race of
                the 2022 F1 Esports Pro Championship, with Frede in P5 and Marcel in P11.
                In a race much less chaotic than round ten at Suzuka, The Bulls kept their heads down to deliver solid
                drives. Frede took yet another podium, managing to snag P2 in the closing laps of the race, while Marcel
                narrowly missed out on point again, finishing where he started in P11.
                As lights out approached, so did the rain, but both Bulls kept their cool and perfected the race start.
                Frede held position while Marcel found himself immediately battling to keep his place, momentarily
                dropping to P14 but fighting his way back to P12 all before the end of the first lap. While Carreton,
                Idowu and Leigh continued to battle it out behind him, Marcel kept out of trouble and charged on.</p>
